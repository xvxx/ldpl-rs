# LDPL in Rust

_An experimental [LDPL 4.4][ldpl] compiler written in Rust._

> [LDPL][ldpl] is a powerful compiled programming language designed
> from the ground up to be excessively expressive, readable, fast
> and easy to learn. It mimics plain English, in the likeness of the
> good parts of older programming languages like COBOL, with the
> desire that it can be understood by anybody. LDPL was designed to
> run on Unix systems, including AMD-64 Linux, macOS, ARMv8 Linux,
> Android Termux and both Intel and PowerPC OS X (tested from Tiger
> 10.4 onwards). It even supports UTF-8 out of the box.
