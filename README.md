# LDPL in Rust

> [LDPL][ldpl] is a powerful compiled programming language designed
> from the ground up to be excessively expressive, readable, fast
> and easy to learn. It mimics plain English, in the likeness of the
> good parts of older programming languages like COBOL, with the
> desire that it can be understood by anybody. LDPL was designed to
> run on Unix systems, including AMD-64 Linux, macOS, ARMv8 Linux,
> Android Termux and both Intel and PowerPC OS X (tested from Tiger
> 10.4 onwards). It even supports UTF-8 out of the box.

â€” The [Official LDPL Repository][ldpl-repo]

---

This is an experimental **LDPL 4.4** compiler written in Rust. Like
the official compiler, LDPL code is translated to C++ code and then
compiled into a standalone binary. Generated code should be 100%
compatible with the official compiler, meaning LDPL-RS should work
just fine with regular LDPL extensions.

## Building It

LDPL-RS requires **make**, [**cargo**][rustup], [**Rust**][rustup],
[**git**][git], and a [**C++ compiler**][cpp-compiler] to build. Once
you have all those, installation is a breeze:

    git clone git://github.com/xvxx/ldpl-rs
    cd ldpl-rs
    make

If that works, you've successfully built an `ldpl-rs` binary that you
can use to run any of the official LDPL examples:

    git clone -b 4.4 git://github.com/lartu/ldpl
    ldpl-rs examples/99bottles.ldpl

To take it with you, just copy `ldpl-rs` to `/usr/local/bin` or
something else in your `$PATH`.

## Status

This project is in its infancy. It's currently focused on implementing
all LDPL 4.4 statements, including C++ extension support. Once that's
done, we'll move onto these four, higher level goals:

1. Support the same `--flags` as the official compiler.
2. Compile all LDPL 4.4 `examples/`.
3. Pass all LDPL 4.4 [tests].
4. Compile popular LDPL 4.4 [projects].
